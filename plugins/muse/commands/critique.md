Run a Muse Code critique through the plugin bridge.
Position it as a challenge pass that questions the chosen implementation, design choices, tradeoffs, and assumptions.
It is not just a stricter pass over implementation defects.

Raw slash-command arguments:
`$ARGUMENTS`

Core constraint:
- This command is review-only.
- Do not fix issues, apply patches, or suggest that you are about to make changes.
- Your only job is to run the critique and return Muse's output verbatim to the user.
- Keep the framing focused on whether the current approach is the right one, what assumptions it depends on, and where the design could fail under real-world conditions.

Execution mode rules:
- If the raw arguments include `--wait`, do not ask. Run in the foreground.
- If the raw arguments include `--background`, do not ask. Run in a Claude background task.
- Otherwise, estimate the review size before asking:
  - For working-tree review, start with `git status --short --untracked-files=all`.
  - For working-tree review, also inspect both `git diff --shortstat --cached` and `git diff --shortstat`.
  - For base-branch review, use `git diff --shortstat <base>...HEAD`.
  - Treat untracked files or directories as reviewable work for auto or working-tree review even when `git diff --shortstat` is empty.
  - Only conclude there is nothing to review when the relevant scope is actually empty.
  - Recommend waiting only when the scoped review is clearly tiny, roughly 1-2 files total and no sign of a broader directory-sized change.
  - In every other case, including unclear size, recommend background.
  - When in doubt, run the critique instead of declaring that there is nothing to review.
- Then use `AskUserQuestion` exactly once with two options, putting the recommended option first and suffixing its label with `(Recommended)`:
  - `Wait for results`
  - `Run in background`

Argument handling:
- Preserve the user's arguments exactly.
- Do not strip `--wait` or `--background` yourself.
- Do not weaken the critique framing or rewrite the user's focus text.
- `--model` and `--effort` are runtime-selection flags. Preserve them for the bridge call; do not treat them as focus text.
- Leave `--model` and `--effort` unset unless the user explicitly asks for them. Without `--model` the bridge uses `MUSE_CC_MODEL`, or else `spark` (`muse-spark-1.3`), never Muse's contributor default. Accepted effort values: `none`, `minimal`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, `max`, `ultra`.
- The bridge script parses `--wait` and `--background`. Bridge `--background` owns the long-running process group (detached `run-worker` + muse child). Claude Code's `Bash(..., run_in_background: true)` is only for the short enqueue call, not the long critique process.
- `/muse:critique` uses the same review target selection as `/muse:review`.
- Unlike `/muse:review`, `/muse:critique` can still take extra focus text after the flags.

Foreground flow:
- Run:
```bash
node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/muse-bridge.mjs" critique "$ARGUMENTS"
```
- Return the command stdout verbatim, exactly as-is.
- Do not paraphrase, summarize, or add commentary before or after it.
- Do not fix any issues mentioned in the critique output.

Background flow:
- Prefer the bridge's own detached worker so stop owns a stable process group. Ensure the forwarded arguments include `--background` (add it if the user chose background and did not already pass the flag).
- Launch with `Bash` (Claude may still use `run_in_background: true` for the short enqueue call; the long-running work is the bridge `run-worker`):
```typescript
Bash({
  command: `node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/muse-bridge.mjs" critique --background "$ARGUMENTS"`,
  description: "Muse Code critique",
  run_in_background: true
})
```
- Do not call `BashOutput` or wait for completion in this turn.
- After launching the command, tell the user: "Muse Code critique started in the background. Check `/muse:runs` for progress. Stop with `/muse:stop`."
